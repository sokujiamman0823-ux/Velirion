## Integration Points

### With Presale Contract (M2)
- **Function**: `distributePurchaseBonus(address buyer, uint256 tokenAmount)`
- **Called**: When user makes purchase
- **Effect**: Referrer receives 5%-12% bonus based on tier
- **Status**: Integration guide provided

### With Staking Contract (M4 - Future)
- **Function**: `distributeStakingBonus(address staker, uint256 rewardAmount)`
- **Called**: When user claims staking rewards
- **Effect**: Referrer receives 2%-5% bonus based on tier
- **Status**: Ready for M4 integration

### With NFT System (M5 - Future)
- **Trigger**: Tier 2+ achievement
- **Effect**: Automatic NFT minting
- **Status**: Prepared for M5 implementation

---

## Gas Optimization

### Estimated Gas Costs

| Function | Estimated Gas | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| `register()` | ~80,000 | First registration |
| `distributePurchaseBonus()` | ~50,000 | Called by presale |
| `distributeStakingBonus()` | ~50,000 | Called by staking |
| `claimRewards()` | ~45,000 | Token transfer |
| View functions | <1,000 | Read-only |

### Optimization Strategies Applied
- ✅ Use uint256 for all counters
- ✅ Efficient struct packing
- ✅ Mappings over arrays where possible
- ✅ Minimal storage reads
- ✅ Events for historical data

---

## Security Audit Checklist

### Completed Security Measures

- ✅ **Access Control**: Only authorized contracts can distribute bonuses
- ✅ **Reentrancy Protection**: ReentrancyGuard on claim function
- ✅ **Anti-Gaming**: Self-referral and circular referral prevention
- ✅ **Input Validation**: All addresses and amounts validated
- ✅ **Emergency Controls**: Pausable functionality implemented
- ✅ **Safe Transfers**: SafeERC20 used for all token transfers
- ✅ **Event Emissions**: All state changes emit events
- ✅ **Integer Safety**: Solidity 0.8+ overflow protection

### Audit Recommendations

1. **External Audit**: Recommended before mainnet deployment
2. **Bug Bounty**: Consider implementing after launch
3. **Monitoring**: Set up event monitoring for suspicious activity
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider additional rate limits if needed
