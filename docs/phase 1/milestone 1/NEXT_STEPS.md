---

## Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Run Tests (After Compilation Completes)

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

**Expected**: All 28 tests should pass

### Step 2: Check Test Coverage

```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```

**Target**: ≥90% coverage

### Step 3: Deploy to Sepolia

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/01_deploy_token.ts --network sepolia
```

**Requirements**:

- Sufficient Sepolia ETH in wallet
- RPC URL configured in `.env`
- Private key configured in `.env`

### Step 4: Verify on Etherscan

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/verify_deployment.ts --network sepolia
```

**Or manually**:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### Step 5: Update Documentation

After successful deployment, update:

- `.env` → Add `VLR_TOKEN_ADDRESS`
- `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` → Mark tasks complete
- `docs/PROJECT_TRACKER.md` → Update deployment table

## 📋 Complete Command Sequence

Run these commands in order:

```powershell
# 1. Ensure compilation is complete (if still running)
# Wait for: "Compiled X Solidity files successfully"

# 2. Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# 3. Generate coverage report
npx hardhat coverage

# 4. Review coverage (should be ≥90%)
# Open: coverage/index.html in browser

# 5. Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/01_deploy_token.ts --network sepolia

# 6. Verify contract
npx hardhat run scripts/verify_deployment.ts --network sepolia

# 7. Update .env file with deployed address
# VLR_TOKEN_ADDRESS=<address_from_deployment>

# 8. Test contract interaction
npx hardhat console --network sepolia
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Solana Implementation - NOT STARTED

**Status**: ❌ Critical blocker for full Milestone 1 completion

**Required**:

1. Initialize Solana/Anchor project
2. Implement SPL token with 0.5% burn
3. Write Solana tests
4. Deploy to Solana devnet
5. Document Solana deployment

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

**Impact**: Milestone 1 cannot be marked as 100% complete without Solana implementation

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Ethereum Track (Current Focus)

- ✅ VelirionToken.sol implemented
- ✅ Test suite comprehensive (28 tests)
- ⏳ Tests passing (pending execution)
- ⏳ Coverage ≥90% (pending verification)
- ⏳ Deployed to Sepolia (pending)
- ⏳ Verified on Etherscan (pending)

### Solana Track (Not Started)

- ❌ SPL token implementation
- ❌ Solana tests
- ❌ Devnet deployment
- ❌ Documentation

### Overall Milestone 1

- **Ethereum**: ~85% complete
- **Solana**: 0% complete
- **Total**: ~42% complete

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

### Recommended CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx hardhat compile
      - run: npx hardhat test
      - run: npx hardhat coverage
```

## 🚨 Critical Path

**To complete Milestone 1 Ethereum track TODAY**:

1. **Now**: Wait for compilation to finish
2. **Next**: Run tests → Should take 2-5 seconds
3. **Then**: Run coverage → Should take 30-60 seconds
4. **After**: Deploy to Sepolia → Should take 1-2 minutes
5. **Finally**: Verify on Etherscan → Should take 2-3 minutes

**Total Time**: ~10-15 minutes after compilation
