```
Transfer Amount: 1,000,000 tokens
Burn Rate: 0.5% = 5/1000
Burn Amount: 1,000,000 * 5 / 1000 = 5,000 tokens
Transfer Amount: 1,000,000 - 5,000 = 995,000 tokens
```

**Code Implementation:**
```rust
let burn_amount = amount
    .checked_mul(5)
    .ok_or(ErrorCode::MathOverflow)?
    .checked_div(1000)
    .ok_or(ErrorCode::MathOverflow)?;

let transfer_amount = amount

- ✅ Decreases only through burns
- ✅ Never increases beyond mints

---

#### Test 6.2: Supply Conservation Law
**Mathematical Proof:**
```
Sum of All Balances = Current Total Supply
```

**Test Implementation:**
```typescript
const totalBalances = 
  userBalance + 
  recipientBalance + 
  thirdPartyBalance;

assert.equal(totalBalances, currentSupply);
```

**Result:** ✅ Conservation law holds

---

#### Test 6.3: Deflationary Mechanism Verification
**Test Scenario:**
```typescript
Initial Supply: 100,000,000
After 100 transfers: Supply < 100,000,000
Difference: Sum of all burns
```

**Result:** ✅ Deflationary mechanism working correctly

## 🧮 Mathematical Verification

### Burn Calculation Formula

```
Given:
  - Transfer Amount (A)
  - Burn Rate (R = 0.005)

Calculate:
  - Burn Amount (B) = floor(A × R)
  - Transfer Amount (T) = A - B

Verification:
  - B = floor(A × 5 / 1000)
  - T = A - B
  - A = B + T (conservation)
```

### Test Cases Verification

| A | B = floor(A × 0.005) | T = A - B | A = B + T |
|---|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 200 | 1 | 199 | ✅ 200 |
| 1,000 | 5 | 995 | ✅ 1,000 |
| 10,000 | 50 | 9,950 | ✅ 10,000 |
| 100,000 | 500 | 99,500 | ✅ 100,000 |
| 1,000,000 | 5,000 | 995,000 | ✅ 1,000,000 |

**Result:** ✅ All calculations verified
